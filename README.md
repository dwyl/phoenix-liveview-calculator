## WORK IN PROGRESS

This Phoenix LiveView project is being created with the aim of putting into 
practice the theory and knowledge gained from the many 
open source tutorials provided by the wonderful
[dwyl](https://github.com/dwyl).

This readme will include a breakdown for anyone 
else starting their functional programming / elixir 
journey in the hopes that this will be another 
useful resource on that quest.
